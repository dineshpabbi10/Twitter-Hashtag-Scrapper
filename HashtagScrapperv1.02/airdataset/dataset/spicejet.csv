110,2019-02-08 12:01:46,@flyspicejet Each and every @flyspicejet team member is giving different solutions. Worst experience ever. Will never suggest #Spicejet to anyone.

112,2019-02-08 09:23:49,We never saw such type of loot on any domestic or international air route. See the flight fare form New Delhi to Srinagar and New Delhi to Dubai.

113,2019-02-08 07:17:44,Sad to say that #spicejet @flyspicejet flight from #Bangalore to #Hydrabad was canceled due to #operational issues &amp; we were offered full refund or a 8 hour bus ride. I think @flyspicejet should contact other airlines to help their passengers get to their destination #poorservice
