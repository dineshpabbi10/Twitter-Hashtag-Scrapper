8,2019-02-11 20:48:23,#wowair #breakingguitars @wowairsupport as suspected the cowboys at wow air still haven't settled my claim for the guitar their baggage handlers destroyed 6 months ago. Sadly I now have to sue them. What an abysmal bit of customer service.

10,2019-02-10 18:36:05,Fact you can have more than 24 hours in a day. Flying against time from Iceland   On plane #WOWAIR which was great experience - USB to keep phone charged and power for laptop.   #WT2019
11,2019-02-10 15:29:47,We are so sad to be leaving Iceland today. If you want an absolutely amazing weekend getaway and live in Toronto... try @wowairsupport !! It‚Äôs cheaper than driving to Montreal and the same amt of time! #wowair #traveliceland #icelandtravel @wowair #exploreiceland #travelcouple https://t.co/fj1svMvxbH
12,2019-02-08 06:31:22,"So @wow_air, the joke keeps getting worse: First you deliver my luggage the day I fly BACK (10 days too late), then it takes days to agree on a compensation, now I've been waiting since October for the money. Worse thing: 4 mails, no answer. Way to go @wowairsupport. #wowair."
